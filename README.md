# Problem

How to see all the timeframes at once and categorize trades.

# Solution

UI tool which connects to my database and fetch trade data. It has also functionality to update trade data. This piece of software has given me lot of clarity where to focus on.

# Visualization

There is visual presentation of the tool. It shows executions on all time frames and trade table. On trade table user can give ratings and pick up setup category. These are inserted to trades table in my PostgreSql database

Todo:

- Develop better organized UI structure
- Plot multiple trades once
- Make code more readable. Now it's working but I can't be quite content with my solutions in coding this
